## About The App
trendE is an eComemrce website focused on local vendors/sellers. trendE aims to
put local sellers on the map, increasing their reach!
With an option to upload products, trendE gives its vendors full control to
 upload products whenever they want, without being dependent on someone. In addition 
to selling their products, vendors can track their sales and of course get the appreciation 
that they deserve from their customers in terms of ""vendor reviews.""
For customers, trendE is a place to explore everything that is being 
offerred by the local vendors. Our site offers clean, non distracting 
look where customers can search for the product and 
buy it within seconds!

## Technologies
I used `React.js`, `Node.js`,`Express`,`MySQL`,`Knex`,`Stripe`,`JWT Authentication`

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`- to install all the dependencies
- run `npm start` - to start the app on the port available ( generrally PORT 3000 )

## Approach
I adopted the `BEM` naming style for my css class names and site was created using mobile first approach.

## Status
trendE is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out soon.
